## 📌 Challenge Description

Participants were given a **single image taken from Google Maps Street View** and asked:

> *“Which famous place does this image lead to?”*

No coordinates, metadata, or additional hints were provided.  
The challenge relies purely on **visual OSINT and geolocation techniques**.

---

## 🧠 Solution Walkthrough

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Identify the Image Source

The image is clearly from **Google Maps Street View**, identifiable by:
- Camera angle typical of Street View
- Faded **Google watermark** on the pavement
- Urban street-level perspective

➡️ This confirms that **geolocation OSINT** is the intended approach.

---

## 🌍 Step 2: Language Recognition

One of the most important clues is visible on the **blue road sign**:

- The text is written in **Hebrew**
- Hebrew script is unique and immediately recognizable

➡️ This narrows the country down to **Israel**

---

## 🌿 Step 3: Environmental & Infrastructure Clues

Additional observations:
- Mediterranean-style vegetation
- Stone-paved sidewalks (very common in Jerusalem)
- European-style traffic signage
- Clean, well-planned urban layout

➡️ These indicators strongly suggest **Jerusalem**

---

## 🏛️ Step 4: Area Context Analysis

The surrounding environment shows:
- Wide roads
- Minimal commercial activity
- Pedestrian walkways
- Security fencing and controlled surroundings

➡️ This suggests a **government or institutional area**, rather than a residential or market street.

---

## 🔎 Step 5: Translating the Sign (OSINT Pivot)

A common OSINT technique:
- Zoom into the Hebrew sign
- Translate it using **Google Translate** or **Google Lens**

This reveals:
- Directional signage consistent with **government districts**

---

## 🗺️ Step 6: Landmark Association

At this stage, the logical question becomes:

> *What is the most famous government building in Jerusalem?*

The answer:
- **The Knesset** — Israel’s Parliament

---

## ✅ Step 7: Final Confirmation

To verify:
1. Open **Google Maps**
2. Search for **“Knesset Jerusalem”**
3. Enable Street View around nearby roads

The following match perfectly:
- Sidewalk patterns
- Trees and bushes
- Road layout
- Sign placement

➡️ **Location confirmed**

Savvy{The Knesset}  or Savvy{Knesset}
