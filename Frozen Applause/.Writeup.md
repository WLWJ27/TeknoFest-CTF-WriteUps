## Description

A traveler once wrote in his journal about a summer evening that left him speechless.  
He described a grand open-air arena, surrounded by a modern skyline, where the crowd roared louder than the wind.  
The event was not an ordinary game — the best of the best had gathered, lights shining brighter than usual, history being made in front of thousands.
